📊 Linear Regression on Height-Weight Dataset
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Linear Regression using a dataset that relates height and weight. The goal is to predict weight based on height using a supervised learning approach.

📁 Files Included
Linear_Regression.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of linear regression.

height-weight.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

📌 Features
Data loading and preprocessing

Data visualization (scatter plot)

Model training using Linear Regression

Prediction and evaluation (using R² Score)

Visualization of the regression line

📂 Dataset Description
Source: Manually uploaded height-weight.csv

Columns:

Height: Height of the individual (inches)

Weight: Weight of the individual (pounds)
